2. **Make all bets the same opacity**
   - Ensure consistent visual treatment across all bet cards
   - Remove any opacity variations between different bet states and indicate their status (Pending, Active, Cancelled, Expired, Resolved) with a pill in the top right

3. **Add error message for users without a wallet**
   - Display clear error message when the bet opponent or judge doesn't have a wallet

5. **Fix dates in UI**
   - There should be 3 dates in this UI
       - Created (Nov 4)
       - Expires (Nov 11)

   - What should not show is the date when the bet funds become elligible to be returned
